# Neopixel LED Controller using SystemVerilog/FPGA
Logic designed using an explicit finite state machine
Verified using assertions/constrained randomized stimulus in testbench, and synthesized on a CycloneÂ® V FPGA

The string of LEDs responds to a serial, pulse width modulated waveform. Each bit is sent according to the waveform:

24 contiguous bits form an LED command. Each of the three bytes controls the intensity of the red,
green, and blue colors.

A display packet is made of multiple LED commands, one for each LED in the string. 
50 microseconds must be waited before sending another display packet. 
The illustration below shows a single LED command, consisting of 24'hF08025, followed by a space and the beginning of the next display packet.

## FPGA Interface
Pin GPIO_0[1] is a general purpose I/O pin connected to the serial output that drives the LED strip

## ChipInterface.sv 
Physical hardware connections to the FPGA switches/keys, synthesized with Quartus II Prime software
Four different modes based on Switches/keys
1. Regular LED mode
     One random color shows up at a time (no SW activated)
2. Neon SW[1] && ~SW[2]
      Alternates between several neon displays, updates simultaneously 
3. Rainbow display: SW[1] &&  SW[2]
     Fixed rainbow display
4. Christmas Mode: SW[2] && ~SW[1] 
     Red/green on every other pixel, back and forth blinking

## NeoPixelController.sv
Finite state machine logic to send bitstream given load/send signals from the Task2 hardware thread

## NeoPixelController_test.sv
Testbench (assertions, constrained randomized tests) to test and simulate sending patterns to the LED strip 
for verification purposes 

##  Task2.sv
Hardware thread, tells NeoPixelController to load/send
Color Module tells it which color/pattern to use
Different patterns: Neon, Christmas, Rainbow, Regular 

##  Library.sv
Datapath elements (counters, registers)
